# mapping-project

A Python translation of my R code for a programming project undertaken at university.

During my time at university, I took an interesting module named 'Geocomputation'. It combined two things I feel most passionately about, geography and programming. In this module, we covered a variety of statistical techniques employed by geographers, and this resulted in the creation of a social atlas. For my topic, I explored burglary crime across London and any particular spatial relationships between the two variables. I won't dive into the geographical scholarship too much here, as the essay was written quite some time ago. The main focus of the code in this repository was to explore how geographical programming is conducted in Python. As I primarily program in Python, I wanted to ensure I could conduct a very similar analysis in Python.

This project seemed to lend itself quite nicely to the Jupyter Notebook format, something I had little experience with until this project. It's something I will consider using more of in the future, especially for data analysis. Perhaps I could one day take my [pairs trading](https://github.com/CallumJackson90/pairs-trading) project and rewrite it inside a Jupyter Notebook.
